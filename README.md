# PowerCo-Predective-Model-and-Advanced-Analytics

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise),
and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. 
They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

## My tasks in this project was devided into 4 main tasks:

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis "(BCG) EDA & Data Cleaning.ipynb"

Performing some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters,
and variable distributions. This first subtask is to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset.

### Task 2: Feature Engineering  "(BCG) feature-engineering.ipynb"

Brainstorm and build out features to uncover signals in the data that could inform the churn model.

### Task 3: Modeling & Evaluation "(BCG) Modeling & Evaluation.ipynb"

Train a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn and evaluate the performance of the model with suitable evaluation metrics,
also in this task I tested if the company applies 20% discount will this affects the customers churn probability.

### Task 4:  "(BCG) Findings & Recommendations.ppt"

This was a 1 slide to summarize my findings.
